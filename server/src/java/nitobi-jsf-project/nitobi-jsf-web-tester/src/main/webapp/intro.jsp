    Welcome to the example application for the Nitobi JSF components. In this app are
    pages showing all the components in action, their JSP page source and their back-end
    source code.
</p>

<p>Some of the highlights of the Nitobi JSF components are:</p>
<ul class="instructions">
	<li>
        No more need to hand code your script and stylesheet imports. Each component 
        knows what dependencies it has and it loads them straight from the jar.
    </li>
	<li>
        Simpler Gets and Saves using the same Managed Beans as the rest of your JSF
        applications.
    </li>
	<li>Autoinitializing components.</li>
	<li>
        Most attributes are ValueExpression objects in the background, which means 
        full use of Unified Expression Language and easy access to your other 
        Managed Bean attributes.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    NOTE: The Nitobi JSF components are designed for JSF 1.2. They will not work 
    in a JSF 1.1 environment. If you need this functionality, please contact us.
</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
